## Election Audit Summary
This election audit program was written in a way that it could be used to analyze any election data by just changing the data file (CSV).  The program would also easily, without modification, expand to report on elections which involve more than three counties and/or candidates.  With simple modifications this program could report on other demographic data for the voters, for example city or precinct.
